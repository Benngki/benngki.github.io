This research focuses on hate speech in the context of presidential elections and the challenges it poses on social media. In this paper, we utilize Twitter as a case study to develop an effective hate speech identification technique. The method consists of refining IndoBERT using a dataset of Indonesian tweets regarding the election that have been pre-processed to reduce noise and classified as hate speech or non-hate speech using a pre-trained model. The accuracy, precision, gain and F1 score of the model were used to assess its performance. The results show that the IndoBERT model detects hate speech in Indonesian Twitter data with high accuracy with 92% accuracy.",
